# Bike Parts Quiz - Fixed! ✅

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Edit Mode Drag is Now WORKING!** 🎉
   - **Problem**: Drag listeners were only on the board, not tracking across the whole document
   - **Solution**: Moved to document-level `mousemove` and `mouseup` listeners
   - **Result**: You can now click and drag pins smoothly, even if you move your mouse outside the image

### 2. **Pin Positions Repositioned** 📍
   - All 41 pins have been repositioned to better align with typical bicycle anatomy:
     - **Wheels**: Front at (72%, 65%), Rear at (28%, 65%)
     - **Handlebar area**: At the top front (60-72%, 28-30%)
     - **Seat**: In the middle (45%, 28%)
     - **Frame tubes**: Properly positioned across the frame
     - **Chain components**: Bottom center area (40-50%, 68-75%)
     - **Brakes**: Front right and rear left positioning
     - **Pedal**: At the bottom center (50%, 75%)

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Cursor changes to "grab" in Edit Mode (visual feedback)
   - Smooth drag experience with no jank
   - Positions auto-save to localStorage
